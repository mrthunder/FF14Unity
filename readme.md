# Final Fantasy 14 in Unity

## About
I have been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14 these days, and I have enjoyed a lot. So much so, I decided to recreate some of the systems from the game. I am doing this just for fun.

## Pacing
I am not doing this every day, because I am job hunting ~~and playing the game~~. So this project will not be getting updates every day.

## More information
If you found this project and also play Final Fantasy 14 and want to try out what I have been doing, feel free to download and try it out. I might build the project from time to time and upload it to the release section.
